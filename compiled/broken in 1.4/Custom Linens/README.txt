Custom Linens 1.1 by Mevima

INSTALLATION:
1. Extract the CustomLinens folder into the Mods folder in the Stardew Valley directory. You must have SMAPI installed to run mods.
	SMAPI Location: http://canimod.com/for-players/intro

2. Open config.json with any text editor. It will read:
	"LinensChosen": "default"
Change "default" to your chosen linen style. Options are:
	"LinensChosen": "blacksatin"
	"LinensChosen": "desert"
	"LinensChosen": "dragon"
	"LinensChosen": "greenstripes"
	"LinensChosen": "pinkfloral"
Typing anything else will simply revert the linens to default graphics.

3. Open your Stardew Valley game using the SMAPI Mod EXE, as instructed. The bed in your house should be modified with your pretty new linens! Each set comes with a complimentary dish towel in the kitchen.

ALTERNATE INSTALLATION:
If you do not have nor want SMAPI, simply move your chosen linen's .xnb files (both farmhouse_tiles and townInterior) into the Stardew Valley/Content folder, change the file names to farmhouse_tiles.xnb and townInterior.xnb, and overwrite the existing file.

*

UNINSTALL:
1. Move 
	Stardew Valley/Mods/CustomLinens/Linens/farmhouse_tiles.xnb
and
	Stardew Valley/Mods/CustomLinens/Linens/townInterior.xnb
to
	Stardew Valley/Content/
Overwrite the existing file. This will put your linens back to the default graphics.

2. Delete the CustomLinens folder.
