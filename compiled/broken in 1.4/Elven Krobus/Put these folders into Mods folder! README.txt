I hope you enjoy this mod! 

Please put BOTH folders inside your MODS folder! Here's how the file tree should look:

Stardew Valley -> Mods -> [CP] Elven Krobus / ElvenKrobus

Both folders, separately, need to be in the Mods folder to work. The CP folder has the images and such, the other has the code necessary to change Krobus's sprite height.

Inside the CP folder, there is a "Config" file that you can edit to change Krobus's appearance!

Drowelf - the default, a typical drow, white hair, red eyes, gray skin.
Purpledrow - Drow with white hair, purple eyes and skin.
Bluedrow - Drow with white hair, yellow eyes, dark blue skin.
Browndrow - Drow with white hair, red eyes, dark brown skin.
Albino - Pale gold hair, pink eyes, pale skin.
Brown - Brown hair and eyes, cream skin.
Darkbrown - Brown hair and eyes, darker brown skin.
Darkerbrown - Black hair and eyes, dark brown skin.
Moss - Green hair and eyes, cream skin.
Vampire - Black hair, red eyes, and white skin.
Redhead - Red hair, green eyes, pink skin.


Hope you enjoy this mod! Have fun playing SDV!
