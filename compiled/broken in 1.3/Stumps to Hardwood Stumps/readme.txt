"Stumps to Hardwood Stumps" by Nishtra

Turns regular stumps left after cutting down trees into hardwood stumps after several days.


Installation
0. Install the latest version of SMAPI
1. Unpack the downloaded zip file and place it's contents into the Mods folder
2. Tweak the configs to your liking. If there is no config file or you want to reset all settings to default, delete existing config file and the next time you load the game a new config will be created.
3. Play the game.


Config settings:
 > "daysToTransform": How many days will it take a stump to transform. Affected by daily luck. Default 4.
 > "minDistance": Minimal number of tiles between 2 big stumps. Default 2.

Note: This mod uses both regular and per-save configs. Main settings are in the regular config and per-save config file saves a collection of stumps that you don't need to modify.

Requires SMAPI!
