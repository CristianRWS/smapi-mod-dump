1.0
Initial release.
Replaces crops tilesheet to display different crops sprites depending on the state of the ground (dry or watered).
Uses combined tilesheet with normal and dry sprites.
Runs when player uses watering can or enters Farm or Greenhouse.

1.1
Added config option to add maps other than Farm and Greenhouse where mod should run.
Now uses separate tilesheets.
In absence of normal crops tilesheet can use /Content/TileSheets/crops.xnb asset.
Dry crops tilesheet doesn't need to contain dry versions of all the crops. Though it's still recommended and a player will be warned.
By separating tilesheets, making them less dependent on one another and adding a bit of content analysis the mod theoretically should peacefully coexist with mods adding new crops.

1.2
Rewrote trigger condition from being based on monitoring stamina to triggering when holding down/releasing useTool or action button. Now it is more reliable and will trigger when planting new crops (and much less resource friendly).
Added resetCrops method to avoid invisible crops problem after deleting the mod.
Added Longevity crops tilesheet to the package.
Fixed path to tilesheets to avoid errors with SMAPI 2.1

1.2.1
Added a console command to save unmodified crops tilesheet, to avoid having to unpack .xnb file.

1.3
Rewrote using Harmony library by pardeike. Now update method is executed after "performToolAction" and "plant" game methods instead of reacting to key presses.
Added a method to generate dry crops tilesheet (by desaturating original) if it's missing from Data folder or doesn't have all the crops.
Added a console command to save dry crops tilesheet.

1.3.1
Fixed the updateCropAtTile method firing when planting fertilizer, which led to some errors and fertilizer not being consumed.

1.3.2
Fixed an error that occured when a bomb explosion covered HoeDirt tiles.

1.3.3
Fixed compatibility with CustomCrops (and other mods using the same method to add new crops).

1.4
Compatibility fix for Stardew Valley 1.3-beta
To make the mod compatible with multiplayer crops update method is executed several times per second instead of having trigger events.

1.4.1
Compatibility fix for Stardew Valley 1.3.17/SMAPI 2.6-beta.16. Config and texture initialization moved from loading TitleMenu to loading a save.
Fixed a bug where crops planted in Garden Pots wouldn't reset to their normal version.
