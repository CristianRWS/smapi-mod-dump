1.0
Used (almost) unaltered code from the game .exe for spawning ores on the HIll-Top Farm map.
Added the option for setting custom coordinates to define the spawning area.
The mod is restricted to Hill-Top Farm map.

1.1
Added the option to turn off the spawn of ores/geodes and turn on the spawn of gems/mystic stones.
Added settings to alter the chances for certain objects to spawn.

1.2
Added the fluctuations to the spawn chances based on character mining level, daily luck and the deepest reached level in the mines.
Fixed conditional statements that locked the spawn of gems to be dependent on the mine level regardless of the option setting.

1.3
Removed restriction to Hill-Top Farm map. Now can be used on all farms.
Added the setting for tile properties where objects can be spawned. Available values "Dirt", "Grass" and "Diggable".
Fixed the triggering condition.

1.3.1
Removed restriction to Hill-Top Farm map completely.
Updated the code to be compatible with SMAPI 1.0. Removed deprecated SMAPI methods.

1.3.2
Patched for SMAPI 1.1
Added setting "explodeValuables"

1.4
Added "skillLevelCorrelation" (lock certain ores/gems from spawn until required skill level is reached) and "personalExperienceCorrelation" (lock certain ores/gems from spawn until they are found and shipped) settings.
Added "bonusPerSkillLevel" setting to affect the number of items to spawn.
Replaced "initialSpawnChance" with "baseNumber" to make the setting more understandable and give more stable results.
Removed "explodeValuables" option to avoid confusion when using "Mining with Explosives" mod. All items except Mystic Stones can be destroyed with bombs.
Changed "soilType" setting to accept several values.
Items can now spawn in the grass (not just a tile with Grass property) and on hoed tiles.
Reworked item selection code.

1.5
Added "discovering" new mineable objects (respawning rocks as new items) with shipping ores/gems and/or raising mining skill level.
Added "verbose" setting to limit the amount of messages logged to console.

1.6
Added an option to exclude areas from spawn.
Added base spawn chance for each ore to config.
Reworked settings defining a spawn area. Now it is possible to select several areas.
Reworked spawn area definition and tile selection code.
Fixed bug that prevented spawning ores and gems.

1.7
Patched for SMAPI 2.0
Made config file tied to character. Now there is no need to move config file around when switching to a character with a different farm layout.
Added an option to enable spawning items on maps other than Farm.
Added a config option for Mystic Stone spawn chance. Because why not.
Changed UniqueID in manifest file to recommended format.

1.8
Added "Stone" soil type.
Added "All" soil type.
Added dangerousSettings option. It removes some some config checks and enables "All" soil type setting (also possibly ruins balance).
Added a check for warp points to avoid blocking location's entrances/exits with spawned objects.
The locations list variable is cleared on loading a save to avoid checking locations set for a different character.
Added an option to use different location specific settings by making a "%" entry in the "Areas" list for a given location.
Made config more readable.
Merged "includedAreas" and "excludedAreas" into a single "Areas" field. Inclusion/exclusion now are specified by '+' or '-' before coordinates.
Removed "spawnOres", "spawnGeodes", "spawnGems", "spawnMysticStones" settings. To stop corresponding objects from spawning it's enough to set their chance to 0.

1.9
Compatibility fix for Stardew Valley 1.3
