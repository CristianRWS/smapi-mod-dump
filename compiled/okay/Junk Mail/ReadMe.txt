Junk Mail MOD by Taskmaster

Thanks for taking time to give my silly MOD a try.  This MOD will occassionally, based on random chance, send the player game-related junk mail.
The mail is designed to add an little extra "lore" to the game in some cases, and just to be fun in other cases.  Each junk mail will only be sent
once so that you are not reading the same thing over and over.

There are some adjustable options in the config.json file that will be created upon first run.  These options are explained in detail below:

MailChance - This is the percaent chance - roughly - that a junk mail will be sent to the player.  It defaults to 10 (10%).  Setting this value to 0
             will result in no mail being sent, while setting it to 100 (100%) will result in a junk mail arriving every day.

MailNotification - This MOD will display a notification first thing in the morning if you have awaiting mail.  Set this value to "None" if you
                   do not wish to receive this notification.  "Basic", the default, will show a simple "You've Got Mail" message.  Lastly, if
				   you set this value to "detailed", you will be given a message that indicates the number of letters that are in the mailbox.

MailReplay - This MOD will only send each junk mail once, and after all junk mail has been sent (18 or so) it will not repeat by default.  You can
             set this value to "true" if you want the MOD to reset and start sending the junk mail again.

ShowDebug - This option will display debug notifications to the console window whne set to "true".  This has no value unless you are just curious.



If you are a Steam user, I have created two Community Guides that you might enjoy.  They are not your typical regurgitation of the Stardew Valley Wiki,
but are shoort stories based on the game designed to add "lore" to the game experience.  Folks seem to enjoy them and I am sure you will too.

If you care to trade cards and craft badges, feel free to send me a friend request (https://steamcommunity.com/id/Taskmaster1/).  I may not accept it
depending on your profile (do we have anything in common or not), but it is nothing personal.  I can only keep track of so many folks and I don't like
to be rude.

Enjoy the MOD!
