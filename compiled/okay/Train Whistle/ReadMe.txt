"Train Whistle" MOD by Taskmaster
(C) 2019, All Rights Reserved


Introduction
------------
Use the powerful jade train whistle to summon a train almost at will.  You will receive a letter with details as part of the MOD.  

NOTE: This mod is functional, allowing you to summon a train directly in the game, but it is not complete in that I have not made a jade train whistle item yet.  
      If folks like the functionality then I will continue learning how to do this.  I just wanted to get the good part - summon trains - into the game for folks
	  to enjoy.


Configuration
-------------
There is only one adjustable option in the config.json file that will be created upon first run.  This option is explained in detail below:

ShowDebug - This option will display debug notifications to the console window whne set to "true".  This MOD doesn't have any debug to log at the moment.


Console Command
---------------
In the event it is necessary to receive the instuctional mail again, type the following command in the SMAPI console window.

     reset_trainwhistle


History
-------
v1.0.0     - Initial Release
V1.0.1     - Correct Update Id.  Handle game controller.  Send intructional email only once

If you like this MOD you might want to check out my "Junk Mail" mod as well: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4452/

If you are a Steam user, I have created two Community Guides that you might enjoy.  They are not your typical regurgitation of the Stardew Valley Wiki,
but are short stories based on the game designed to add "lore" to the game experience.  Folks seem to enjoy them and I am sure you will too.
