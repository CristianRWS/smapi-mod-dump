# Yet Another Harvest With Scythe Mod

## Description
Allows you to harvest all crops and forage using the scythe. They can also still be plucked, without having to press a toggle button (though this can be disabled in `config.json`). Unlike other 'harvest with scythe' mods, this patch does not affect your savegame. So it is possible to revert to the old behavior by simply removing this mod.

## Config
*Note: run Stardew Valley once with this mod enabled to generate the `config.json` file.*

* `HarvestForage`: Should the game be patched to allow harvesting forage with the scythe? Default = true.
* `AllHaveQuality`: If the crop drops more than 1 harvest, should the additional harvest have the same quality as the first? Otherwise additional harvest will always have normal quality. Default = false.
* `ScytheHarvestFlowers`: Can flowers be harvested with the scythe? Note that if this is disabled, flowers can still be plucked by hand, regardless of whether plucking by hand is disabled. Default = true.
* `AllowManualHarvest`: Whether crops should also remain pluckable by hand. Default = true;

## Dependencies
This mod requires the following mods to be installed:

* [SMAPI](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400)
* [StardewHack](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3213)

## Known bugs
