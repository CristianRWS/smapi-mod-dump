       Version 2.5
       
       - Now uses exact cursor position rather than tile position for spawning for monsters that aren't tile based.
       - Fixed a bug where trying to spawn a Metal Head crashes the spawning menu.
       - Fixed a bug where hovering over tiles that don't exist (e.g. in buildings) with a Duggy crashes the spawning menu.
       - Code cleanup and optimization
