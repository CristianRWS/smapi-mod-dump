       Compatibility with SDV1.4:
       * Fixed method signatures
       * Remove DeepWoods locations from cache when removing the from game
       * Updated some of the logic to fit changes in game (daily luck, animation rendering, draw logic)
       
       Thanks to Mizzion for the preliminary patch!
