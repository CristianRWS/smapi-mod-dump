3. Run the game using SMAPI.

**Content Patcher version** (won't work with other content packs that replace Cindersnap Forest):
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. [Install Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915).
3. Unzip the file download [from Nexus Mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3750) somewhere (not in your `Mods` folder!).

## Usage
Just load a save with the riverlands farm, and you'll see the new map! If you loaded an existing
save and you have things in the water, see [Saves#Change farm type](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves#Change_farm_type)
for some suggested fixes.

The beach is fertile, so you can plant crops in the sandy areas too:

The exit to Marnie's ranch is on the right:
